SPRINT 4 RETROSPECTIVE (Team 8)
=====================================

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs done 6/6
- Total points committed vs done 44/44
- Nr of hours planned vs spent (as a team) 72h/66h 5m


**Remember**  a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   |   6     |    -   |  36h 5m    |  29h 10m     |
| 21bis  |   4     |    5   |  3h 15m    |   2h 40m     |
| 22     |   4     |    5   |  4h 45m    |   5h 20m     |
| 23     |   4     |    5   |  4h 45m    |   4h 55m     |
| 24     |   5     |    5   |  3h 50m    |   4h 5m      |
| 25     |   5     |    3   |  3h 40m    |   3h 45m     |
| 26     |   5     |   21   |  14h 40m   |  16h 10m     |



- Hours per task (average, standard deviation): average 2h, standard deviation 2h 22m

- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent from previous table: 4260/3965 = 1.07

  
## QUALITY MEASURES

  - Coverage: 83.5%
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 7h
  - Total hours spent: 6h 50m
  

- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated: 2h 5m
  - Total hours spent: 1h 30m
- Technical Debt management:
  - Total hours estimated: 5h
  - Total hours spent: 1h 10m
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube: 3h
  - Hours spent on remediation: 1h 10m
  - debt ratio (as reported by SonarQube under "Measures-Maintainability") 0%
  - rating for each quality characteristic reported in SonarQube under "Measures": Reliability: A, Security: A, Maintainability: A  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

  There weren't so big errors in estimation.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

  Positive: organization among the team was better, so we didn't face any last-minute issue.

  Negative: none.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 

  We correctly implemented all the stories, without any misunderstanding with respect to the requirements.
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

  None.

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.). Propose one or two

  We would like to achieve a better testing coverage (we fixed our objective to 90%).

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!

  We have received very positive feedbacks during the demo and the team coordination was better than the previous Sprints.
